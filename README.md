# Gut Microbiome – MetaBAT2 Binning Pipeline

This repository currently contains step-by-step workflows and scripts for **genome binning using MetaBAT2**, a key step in analyzing gut microbiome metagenomic data.

More tools will be added soon as the full pipeline is built.

## MetaBAT2 Binning Pipeline

Detailed guide available in  
[`docs/metabat2_pipeline.md`](docs/metabat2_pipeline.md)

To run MetaBAT2 automatically from a terminal (after cloning this repo):

```bash
bash scripts/run_metabat2.sh
```

## Work in Progress

This project will soon include:
- FastQC for quality control
- Trimmomatic for adapter trimming
- Bowtie2 for host read removal
- Kraken2 for taxonomic profiling
- HUMAnN for functional profiling
- MEGAHIT for assembly

Stay tuned!
